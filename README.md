# buy-the-dip

"Buy the dip" is a common phrase we're hearing a lot more in the world of investing, but what does it mean and what are the benefits?

According to investopedia, "Buy The Dip" means purchasing an asset after it has dropped in price. The belief is that the new lower price represents 
a bargain as the "dip" is only short term blip and the asset, with time, is likely to bounce back and increase in value.

I created Buy The Dip to help frame the psychology around stock "dips" and "down days", as these days could potentially be the best buying opportunity
for most stocks. With Buy The Dip you'll be able to identify these dips and calculate their potential returns if you would have invested.
